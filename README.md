Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The purpose of this project is to provide an online platform for training students for their DMV testing. The client is the DriverPass company. The system should be able to provide users with various training packages, ability to schedule trainings, track results, and utilize online training as well as in person vehicle training, all while remaining up to date with DMV requirements.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well maintaining a way of communicating to the business owner in a way that was easy to understand, withiut too much technical language.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise some of my UML diagrams. I feel, as someone new to these, I could use more time to learn and create more in depth visual diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The way I interpreted the user needs was to be as specific as possible with my note taking from the initial interview with the owner. This gave me a good foundation to then build use cases off of, and prepare for user needs. It is very important to keep the users experience/perspective in mind, as this is really the end goal of the project, to meet these specific users' needs. In this case, their needs are to utilize a reliable online system to prepare for driver tests.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The way I have approached designing this system was from the ground up, and with good communication. I really tried to adhere as close as possible to the owners requests/ideas, and then take this a step further by smoothiung out the user experiences. Communication, especially precice and clear communication, is I think the best tactic for an efficient system design.
